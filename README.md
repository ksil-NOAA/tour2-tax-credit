# tour2-tax-credit (Tourmaline fork)

**A modified version of [tax-credit](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit) (TAXonomic ClassifieR Evaluation Tool), adapted to run as the reference-database benchmarking step of [Tourmaline 2](https://github.com/aomlomics/tourmaline).**

This is **not** the upstream tax-credit repository. It is a fork maintained for use with Tourmaline, and it is not intended to reproduce the analyses of the original tax-credit paper. If you want the original framework and its supplementary notebooks, use [caporaso-lab/tax-credit](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit).

---

The original tax-credit is a notebook-driven framework: you open a Jupyter notebook per analysis, edit paths and parameter sweeps, and run the cells. This fork keeps the scientific core of that framework — the simulation, evaluation and plotting code — but designed to run through [Tourmaline](https://github.com/aomlomics/tourmaline/tree/V2), which drives everything from a YAML config.

Tourmaline's `scripts/run_tax_credit.py` imports it and runs the whole benchmark: it builds the simulated datasets, emits and executes the classification jobs, scores the assignments, and writes summary tables and plots.

## How it differs from the original tax-credit

- **Trimmed to what Tourmaline uses.** The legacy notebook-only modules (`eval_framework`, `mock_evaluation`, `biom_cache`, `process_mocks`, `mock_denoise`, `mock_transport`, `mock_quality`, `mockrobiota_extract`, `simulated_communities`) have been removed. See [Package layout](#package-layout) for what remains.
- **New evaluation modes.** Random-split cross-validation (`cross-validated-trad`, with a configurable query-set size) and running a full database against itself (`self-validated`) have been added alongside the original taxonomy-stratified folds, with shared reference artifacts to avoid duplicating a database per fold.
- **New mock-community implementation.** `tax_credit.mock_community` replaces the old `mock_evaluation` / `eval_framework` scoring path, and works from feature tables, ASV sequences and expected composition or per-ASV "trueish" taxonomies.
- **Log analysis and plot theming.** `tax_credit.log_analysis`, `tax_credit.log_plotting` and `tax_credit.plot_theme` were added to summarize per-taxon classifier behaviour and to give the generated figures a consistent look.
- **Modernized environment.** Targets QIIME 2 amplicon 2024.10 (Python 3.10). 

## Installation

This package expects the scientific stack from a QIIME 2 amplicon environment; it declares no PyPI dependencies of its own.

```bash
conda env create -n qiime2-amplicon-2024.10 \
  --file https://data.qiime2.org/distro/amplicon/qiime2-amplicon-2024.10-py310-osx-conda.yml
conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2024.10

git clone https://github.com/ksil-NOAA/tour2-tax-credit.git tax-credit
cd tour2-tax-credit
pip install -e .
```

Clone it as a sibling of your Tourmaline directory — Tourmaline's `tax_credit_package_dir` defaults to `../tour2-tax-credit`.

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for platform-specific environment files and the non-conda fallback.

Five evaluation modes are supported. The first four are simulated from the reference database itself; `mock-community` requires real sequencing data you supply.

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cross-validated` | Taxonomy-aware K-fold splits; classify held-out sequences. |
| `cross-validated-trad` | Random splits of the query list; the reference keeps every sequence (see caveat below). |
| `novel-taxa` | Hold out whole taxa, so a query's own taxon is absent from the reference. |
| `self-validated` | Classify the full database against itself; a best-case ceiling. |
| `mock-community` | Classify real reads from communities of known composition. |

Benchmark runs are large — a full matrix of databases × methods × parameter sets × folds is hundreds of assignment jobs. Start with a reduced matrix.

### A caveat on `cross-validated-trad`

This mode holds out the query *list* but **not the reference**. Each fold's `ref_seqs.fasta` and `ref_taxa.tsv` are symlinks to the full database, so every query is classified against a reference that still contains it — an exact self-match. A single classifier is also fitted per database and reused across all folds.

Read its scores as a **ceiling measured on a random subset** rather than as cross-validated performance: they are optimistically biased, and fold-to-fold spread understates real variance. Use `cross-validated` (taxonomy-aware) when you want queries genuinely absent from the fold's reference.

By default the whole database is divided between the folds, so each queries `n_sequences / iterations` sequences. Tourmaline's `trad_cv_query_size` shrinks the **total** query pool instead, which is then divided the same way — a **float** in (0, 1] is a **fraction** of the database, an **int** is an **absolute count**, and both describe the total across all folds rather than one fold. With `trad_cv_query_size: 0.2` and `iterations: 8`, 20% of the database is queried in total and each fold holds 2.5% of it. An int larger than a given database warns and uses that whole database instead, so one int can be shared across databases of different sizes. Folds stay disjoint either way. Changing it on a run whose folds already exist requires `force_regenerate: true`, or the old folds are reused at their previous size.

## Package layout

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `framework_functions` | Dataset simulation, parameter sweeps, classification command generation |
| `novel_evaluation` | Scoring for novel-taxa and cross-validated assignments; best-run selection |
| `mock_community` | Mock-community scoring (precision/recall, taxon detection, Bray-Curtis) |
| `log_analysis`, `log_plotting` | Per-taxon classifier behaviour summaries and their figures |
| `plotting_functions`, `plot_theme` | Metric plots and shared figure styling |
| `paths`, `simulation_names` | On-disk layout conventions and simulation naming |
| `taxa_manipulator` | Taxonomy string parsing, normalization and filtering |

Full API documentation is in [docs/python-api.md](docs/python-api.md); on-disk conventions are in [docs/directory-layout.md](docs/directory-layout.md).

## Examples

The notebooks in [`examples/`](examples/) are reference material, not part of the Tourmaline workflow:

- [`cross-validated-and-novel-taxa.ipynb`](examples/cross-validated-and-novel-taxa.ipynb) — comparing rCRUX and CRABS reference databases interactively, using the current API.
- [`mock-community-legacy.ipynb`](examples/mock-community-legacy.ipynb) — **historical reference only.** Its evaluation cells import modules that were removed from this fork and will raise `ModuleNotFoundError`. Use Tourmaline's mock-community mode instead.
